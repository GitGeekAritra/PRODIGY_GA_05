Neural Style Transfer in Google Colab 
This project demonstrates how to apply the artistic style of one image (such as a famous painting) to the content of another image (such as a photograph) using Neural Style Transfer (NST). The implementation runs entirely on Google Colab without requiring a GPU.

What is Neural Style Transfer?
Neural Style Transfer is a technique in deep learning that blends two images:

Content image: the base image whose structure you want to keep

Style image: the artistic image whose visual style (colors, textures) you want to apply

The result is a new image that combines the content of the first with the style of the second.
